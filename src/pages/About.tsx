                SolCue is not a health app. It is not a tracker. It is a living artwork 
                that helps you remember what your body already knows: the ancient rhythm 
                of light and dark that has guided life on Earth for billions of years.

                We have forgotten how to listen to the sun's whispers, how to feel the 
                subtle invitation of dawn, the gentle calling of dusk. This is an 
                invitation back to that knowingâ€”a way of being that expands consciousness 
                through the simplest, most profound practice: being present with light.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we align with nature's timing, we don't just optimize our biology. 
                We remember our place in the larger dance of existence. We become more 
                than humanâ€”we become participants in the cosmic rhythm that moves through 
                all things.

                SolCue offers sacred windowsâ€”extended moments when the light is most 
                medicine, most invitation. These aren't rigid schedules but gentle 
                suggestions from the cosmos itself.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dawn expands for 2 hours and 15 minutes around sunrise. Dusk flows 
                for the same sacred duration around sunset. These are not constraints 
                but spacious invitations to witness the day's most transformative moments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Simply being present with this lightâ€”whether for 5 minutes or an hourâ€”
                begins to attune your entire being to rhythms older than civilization, 
                deeper than thought.

                Created by Damian Ewens, a guide who has spent years learning from the 
                ocean's wisdom. The Ocean State of Mind philosophy recognizes that the 
                most powerful medicine is nature itselfâ€”not as something to consume, 
                but as something to commune with.

                Through 1:1 Flow Coaching, Ocean-Based Rewilding Adventures, and Corporate 
                Wellness Retreats, we help people remember their innate connection to 
                natural rhythms. SolCue extends this practice into daily life.
